# Hi There!
I am Camilla Spingola, a Master's degree graduate in Computer Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Robotics. Currently,I am doing a research grant at the University of Salerno, focusing on the field of Artificial Vision for autonomous driving in high-speed railways. Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a deep passion for my field of study and work, I continuously strive to stay updated with the latest innovations and advancements in this ever-evolving sector.

### ðŸŽ“ Academic backgroud
**Master's Degree in AI Computer Engineering** â€“ UniversitÃ  degli studi di Salerno (Italy)
* 110/110 summa cum laude
* MSc thesis "Detecting obstacles in railway environments in real time": Design and development of an Artificial Vision system for the detection, among all possible obstacles on railways, of rocks, using a camera mounted on board a vehicle. Due to the absence of available data, it has been proceeded with the generation of a synthetic dataset using background images of railway environment. A system with good generalization capability also for obstacles on which it had not been trained on has been obtained.

**Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** â€” UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Salerno (Salerno, Italy) 
* 110/110 summa cum Laude
* Graduated in the earliest possible session, with full marks
* BSc thesis "Conteggio automatico di persone tramite una rete neurale integrata in una web application".
